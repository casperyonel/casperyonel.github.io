                <p className='p-text'>I'm a 23 year old ex. wall street banker turned software engineer.</p>
                <p className='p-text long-line'>I was born in Holland in 1998 but grew up in Cleveland, OH. While attending the finance curriculum at Penn State I attended 2 internships. My first was a credit trading program at J.P. Morgan in New York, NY. My 2nd was as an equity research analyst in Point72's Academy Program. Upon graduation I formally moved to NYC and joined Citi in their FIG investment banking group.</p>
                <p className='p-text long-line'>After 1.5 years of banking, I decided to quit my job and join DevMountain in their 16-week full stack development bootcamp. Coincidentally, this decision was actually motivated by my primary interest in business. I wanted to learn how to build products from the ground up and express the many ideas I've conjured up over the years in my google docs. One area I have been particularly focused on since banking is blockchain technology. Growing up I was a passioante reader of economics which drew me into my first markets intereship at J.P. Morgan. Free markets, libertarianism, and the movement of money in an economy were particular topics I was interested in pursuing in any way possible, and blockchain made that more accessible.</p>
                <p className='p-text long-line'>Looking forward, I am planning on either starting my own company out of bootcamp or joining a very early stage company. If I do choose to pursue one of my ideas, it will most likely be in the world of DeFi. I find projects like Olympus DAO and Klima to be incredibly interesting and inspiring for a young thinker like myself.</p>
